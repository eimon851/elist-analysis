Using BigQuery, I use SQL to answer these specific questions for our stakeholders...

[1](q1_sale_trends_macbook.sql/). What was the monthly refund rate for purchases made in 2020?

[2](q2_refunds_rate_apple/). How many refunds did we have each month in 2021 for Apple products?

[3](q3_refunds_freq.sql/). Are there certain products that are getting refunded more frequently than others? What are the top 3 most frequently refunded products across all years?

[4](q4_acc_creation_customers/). What’s the average order value across different account creation methods in the first two months of 2022? Which method had the most new customers in this time?

[5](q5.order_placement_duration/). What’s the average time between customer registration and placing an order?

[6](q6.market_channel_best/). Which marketing channels perform the best in each region? Does the top channel differ across regions?"
